# 3D-Room-Portfolio

A 3D portfolio website. The website was built using HTML/CSS/Javascript with the help of the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library. The 3D models were built using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

Everything in this repository is Open-Source, use it for whatever you want. If you use this as a base to build your own website, please share with me, I'd love see it :)
